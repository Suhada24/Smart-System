# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Issues
- Multiple Python servers were running simultaneously on ports 8000 and 8080, causing conflicts
- JavaScript files were loading synchronously, blocking page rendering
- Large assets were not being cached properly
- No image optimization strategy in place

## Solutions Implemented

### Server Optimization
1. Stopped all conflicting Python servers
2. Started a single, clean server on port 8000
3. Added .htaccess file for proper caching and compression

### Frontend Optimization
1. Added `defer` attribute to script tags (see loadscript.html)
2. Added preload directives for critical assets (see preload.html)
3. Implemented proper asset caching

### How to implement these changes:

1. Add the script tags with defer attribute from `loadscript.html` to your HTML files
2. Add the preload directives from `preload.html` to the head section of your HTML files
3. Make sure to use the .htaccess file when deploying to a production server

## Additional Recommendations

1. Optimize images:
   - Use WebP format when possible
   - Compress existing images using a tool like TinyPNG
   - Implement lazy loading for images below the fold

2. Reduce JavaScript execution time:
   - Review setTimeout functions in script.js
   - Consider using requestAnimationFrame for animations
   - Implement lazy loading for non-critical JavaScript

3. Browser Caching:
   - The .htaccess file already sets up caching rules
   - Consider using service workers for offline capabilities

4. Use a CDN for assets in production:
   - Move static assets (images, CSS, JS) to a CDN
   - Update references in HTML files

By implementing these optimizations, page loading times should improve significantly and the buffering issues should be resolved.
